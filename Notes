paramteric vs Non parameteric models:

	Parametric model assumes explicit assumption about the model form. 

	1. First, we make an assumption about the functional form, or shape,
	of f. For example, one very simple assumption is that f is linear in
	X:
	f(X) = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βpXp. (2.4)
	This is a linear model, which will be discussed extensively in Chapter
	3. Once we have assumed that f is linear, the problem of estimating
	f is greatly simplified. Instead of having to estimate an entirely
	arbitrary p-dimensional function f(X), one only needs to estimate
	the p + 1 coefficients β0, β1,...,βp.
	2. After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the
	training data to fit or train the model

Non Parametric Model :
	There is no fixed assumption but is more flexible, eg(Trees ). This flexible model are more accurate
	
Trade off btw accuracy &  Model interpretability 
	
	So why would one chose parameteric model - ? .
	Reason :
		when inference is the goal, the linear model may be a good choice since it will be quite easy to understand 
		the relationship between Y and X1, X2,...,Xp.
